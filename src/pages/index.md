  title: Why The Science Seed
  description: The Science Seed™ is a science enrichment program designed to
    develop a love of science that will last a lifetime. Children are natural

    explore.  Preschool and early elementary are the perfect times to start a
    lifelong love of science by introducing students to basic concepts.

  science enrichment for preschool – 2nd grade during the school day and after
  school at several preschools and elementary schools in Arlington, Alexandria,

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
