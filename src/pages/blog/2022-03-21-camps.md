#### **CAMP DESCRIPTIONS**

* GEOLOGY/EARTH SCIENCE: ***Fantastic Fossils & Where they came from!***

In this fun camp, kids will explore the world of fossils and geology! Students will erupt their own volcanoes, create and excavate a dino dig, explore real fossils of all kinds, make a cast of a real fossil and more!  The day is rounded out by outdoor recess, story time tied to the day’s science, free reading, exploration, and a daily journal entry.

* CHEMISTRY: ***Chemistry in the Kitchen!***

In this fun camp, kids will explore chemistry in the kitchen!  For example: What’s the difference in using baking soda or baking powder when making cookies?  How does pan temperature effect how the pancake cooks?  What is the role of yeast in pizza dough?  The day is rounded out by outdoor recess, story time tied to the day’s science, free reading, exploration, and a daily journal entry.

* BIOLOGY: ***Humans: Inside & Out***

In this fun camp, kids will learn about Humans!  We’ll discuss our origins, our habitats, where our ancestors came from, and we’ll explore our senses, skin, body systems, and organs.  We’ll answer age old questions such as: Why do we have bones?  What creates freckles?  How are we different from plants or birds?  What does the nervous system do?  How do germs get inside the body? The day is rounded out by outdoor recess, story time tied to the day’s science, free reading, exploration, and a daily journal entry.

* PHYSICS: ***May the FORCE be with you!***

In this fun camp, kids will explore how things move!  Students will build their own boats and airplanes to learn about sinking, floating, flight, and balance.  They’ll also experiment with gravity, magnets, friction, and simple machines! The day is rounded out by outdoor recess, story time tied to the day’s science, free reading, exploration, and a daily journal entry.
