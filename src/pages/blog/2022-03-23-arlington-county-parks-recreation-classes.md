  Check out this series of classes that introduce children to science, including
  geology, chemistry, biology, physics and nature.  Classes are taught in fun,
  interactive and age-appropriate ways to ensure that your child not only has
  fun, but builds a foundation for a love of science and learning that grows
  with them. Each class includes a note for the parents about what was taught
  and how you can continue the lesson at home.

The class will have a maximum of 14 students and 1 teacher.  We are asking that parents drop their kids in the class and wait outside the classroom (or nearby in the community center) similar to a dance or gymnastics class, so that they are available to assist their own child with potty breaks.  However, if the instructor feels a student would benefit more in class with the parent present, she will invite the parent into the classroom.

## Topic Schedule

Our topic schedule is designed so that your student can take 5 consecutive sessions without repeating a lesson.  Alternatively, your student could take the class only in one particular season and topics would be different from year to year.

See below for which topics are taught in each group.
