The Science Seed™ is a science enrichment program designed to develop a love of science that will last a lifetime. Children are natural scientists; curious and full of the desire to observe and explore.  Preschool and early elementary are the perfect times to start a lifelong love of science by introducing students to basic concepts.

The Science Seed™ teaches geology, chemistry, biology, physics, nature and nutrition in fun, interactive and age-appropriate ways.  Instead of offering sessions in topic themes, we aim for students to understand the breadth of science…science is big and broad!  Therefore, any time your child is enrolled in our classes, whether it is an after school program, through the County classes or during their regular preschool day, they will have a mix of science disciplines.  By experiencing a broad range of topics, we hope all children will learn that they love science!

Does your child love a particular type of science?  Our themed camps will be perfect for them.  Our camp focus on one discipline for a week-long in-depth exploration!
