        Ms. Allegra was not a fan of science until high school, when one teacher
        changed her outlook.  A new-found lover of science, she received her
        B.S. in Biology from Mary Washington College and M.S. in Coral
        Geochemistry from the University of Maryland. Throughout the years she
        has tutored in math and science, including SAT prep.  She also spent
        time teaching marine science to elementary students in the Florida Keys
        and as a Teaching Assistant to undergrads in Environmental Geology at
        UMD.  While teaching at UMD, she won several teaching awards, including
        the Distinguished Teaching Award in 2001.  The first decade of her
        career she has been involved in marine and environmental research at the
        Smithsonian Institution’s Marine Systems Lab and Paleobiology
        Department.


        In 2004, Ms. Allegra took a break from research to stay home with her daughter, who was followed by a baby sister in 2005.  When her eldest daughter entered preschool in 2007, she wanted her to have a positive first experience to start her love of science early.  Ms. Allegra started teaching science to her daughter’s preschool class and the birth of The Science Seed™ concept began.

        Ms. Vesta has been teaching children from preschool to middle school
        since 1996.  She received her BS in Elementary/Early Childhood at
        Kutztown University in Kutztown, Pa. While attending Kutztown
        University, she played field hockey and volunteered at a juvenile
        detention center. She enjoyed helping children and decided to become a
        teacher. After graduating, she moved to Virginia to live closer to her
        family and to start teaching. Her first job was a first grade teacher in
        Prince George’s County, MD.   In 2000, Ms. Vesta moved to Maryland and
        starting teaching in Virginia. That’s where her love for teaching
        science began. She became the Visiting Science Teacher for three schools
        in Alexandria City Public Schools. She taught students from preschool
        through sixth grade hands-on science experiments using the scientific
        method.  She also loves to spend time with her nieces and nephews from
        Pennsylvania and Texas and has enjoyed teaching for The Science Seed for
        several years. (Teaching with The Science Seed since 2013)

      text: Jen loves making discoveries and getting messy with young children! She
        received a BS in Geology with a Minor in Environmental Studies from
        James Madison University and enjoyed a career in the field of
        environmental consulting before taking time off to raise her two
        children. While her children were in preschool, Jen began to develop a
        deep interest in early childhood development.  She began teaching
        preschool music classes across the Northern Virginia area in 2001 and
        then moved into the classroom where she has worked as a lead preschool
        teacher since 2011. Now that her own children are all grown up, she is
        enjoying the opportunity to enrich her days further by sharing her love
        of science with children through The Science Seed program. (Teaching

        Sarah traces her love of science and nature back to her earliest days of
        childhood, where she felt most at home in the woods, examining insects,
        frogs or leaves, or with her hands in the dirt.  After graduating from
        James Madison University with a BS in Biology, she earned her MS in
        Environmental Studies with a concentration in Biology from the Medical
        University of South Carolina and College of Charleston (joint MS
        program).  Sarah discovered a love of teaching while in graduate school,
        where for two years, she taught biology laboratories covering a wide
        range of general biology topics to freshmen students at the College of
        Charleston. Following graduate school, she moved to the DC area to work
        as an Environmental Scientist for Science Applications International
        Corporation (SAIC). Here, her consulting work focused on the field of
        global climate change and carbon sequestration.  After seven years
        working as a consultant, Sarah became a mom to two girls (now ages 10
        and 13) and decided to leave the workplace to devote her time to raising
        her daughters. Science was never far from the picture however, as the
        hours at home were filled with countless creative science experiments,
        nature walks and outdoor biology lessons. Sarah also devoted much of
        this time to volunteering in her daughters’ preschool and elementary
        classrooms, Girl Scout troops, and Sunday school classes. Teaching for
        The Science Seed feels like coming full circle, and she is delighted to
        work with children, inspiring wonder and igniting a desire to fully
        engage with and care for the natural world. (Teaching with The Science
        Seed since 2017)

    - title: Calli Harris
      text: A native of Brazil, Ms Calli moved to the United States at a young age,
        where she pursued her love of science. She earned Bachelor’s degrees in
        Chemistry and Biochemistry from North Carolina State University, with
        Minors in Genetics and Psychology, and began her science career at RTI
        International in the Research Triangle Park. While working for RTI, Ms
        Calli continued her education, ultimately obtaining a Master’s degree in
        Biochemistry. She moved to California in 2003, conducting research in
        the Nutrition Department at the University of California, Davis. After
        her two daughters were born, the Harris family decided to return to the
        East Coast. Ms Calli focused on raising her daughters, volunteering in
        their schools, and giving language lessons to small children. Ms Calli’s
        home is filled with science books and projects for the whole family, and
        teaching with The Science Seed is a natural – and exciting – extension
        of that.  (Teaching with The Science Seed since 2018)

      text: Ms Amanda studied occupational therapy at The University of Scranton and
        has enjoyed working as an occupational therapist in Delaware for the
        past 19 years. While she initially specialized in adult acute care and
        outpatient brain injury, her true passion has always been working with
        children, which started as a swim coach/instructor. This love resulted
        in a career specialization in pediatric occupational therapy. She has
        worked with all ages, across many settings, including the neonatal
        intensive care unit, outpatient clinics, various hospitals,
        daycares/homes, and state eligibility assessment clinics. She recently
        moved from Avondale, Pennsylvania to Arlington, Virginia and has been
        enjoying time at home with her four year old daughter. She does continue
        to work per diem as an occupational therapist in Delaware but is excited
        to also work more locally with the preschoolers, enhancing their natural
        love for science through The Science Seed program. (Teaching with The

      text: Valerie Steenstra is an Arlington native and a strong proponent of
        life-long learning. She graduated with a B.A. in English from Marymount
        University. After spending time in the legal field, she made the
        decision to stay at home with her first child and continued at home with
        her second child. She enjoyed sharing the worlds of science, history,
        and all kinds of learning with her children through museum visits,
        books, nature study, home experiments and art projects. Restless when
        her children were both in preschool, Valerie began to volunteer and
        substitute teach at their school and taught a CCD class at St. Charles
        Borromeo in Arlington. Finding that working with children and sharing
        their exploration of the world is her true vocation, Valerie became an
        Assistant Teacher at Mount Olivet Preschool in 2007, and she continues
        there today as the Lead Teacher in the Infant/Toddler classroom. She has
        also enjoyed teaching multiple pre-school S.T.E.A.M., Art, and Lego
        enrichment classes as well as Big and Little Kid summer camps in
        Arlington and Falls Church. She is very excited to continue to share the
        world of science with more children through The Science Seed program!

  - author: Ann Stich, Director Corpus Christi, Early Childhood Center
    quote: If you are looking for a great program to enrich your Science curriculum
      The Science Seed is fantastic. They first came during camp and the
      children absolutely love it. Our Our 3s and 4s absolutely love the program
      and I love that they give a little note to send home to parents. We are
      definitely doing it again next year.
  - author: Lily Chen, Parent
    quote: Thanks for your terrific teaching which has inspired my children’s deep
      interest in science! My son is the type of kid who would never talk about
      school at home to us. The only exception is after he has your class. Then
      we hear all about it with his non-stop talking at dinner table. We started
      to show them Nature and National Geographic videos to follow up on your
      class. Your slips of the content of the class are great leads for us. As a
      Chinese, I always find the American schools or society emphasizes too
      little about science. Your class totally changed my view on this. So thank
      you for teaching such a great class on science and teaching in the way
      that captures the kids’ imagination. I am just amazed how powerful your
      teaching is!
  - quote: I thought of you today at the playground — my daughter took Science Seed
      in kindergarten at St. Thomas More and is now in 2nd grade. Today when I
      was pushing her on the tire swing, she nonchalantly said that a swing is a
      simple machine. When I asked her where she learned that (thinking that she
      must have learned in class sometime recently or from one of her books),
      she said she learned it in Science Seed. That was almost two years ago!
      This is not that unusual – she often talks about things she learned and
      did in Science Seed. Thanks for developing such a great program!
    author: Marissa Mauer, Parent
  - quote: We loved having The Science Seed enrichment class in our preschool. It
      was the first time we had tried something of this nature and The Science
      Seed folks worked closely with us to design a program that was right for
      us. The Science Seed leaders are excellent educators, using a hands on
      approach and a variety of activities to hold the interest of our 3 and 4
      year old friends! Their flexibility, knowledge of the subject matter, and
      mindfulness of our kids ages and energy was invaluable. Each of our 10
      weeks was better than the last! Every lesson was well planned and executed
      and the children had a great time. The added bonus was the note home to
      parents each week about the day’s activities and the Journal of work that
      parents received after the last class. We are already looking forward to
      next year!
