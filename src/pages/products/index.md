        Ms. Allegra was not a fan of science until high school, when one teacher
        changed her outlook.  A new-found lover of science, she received her
        B.S. in Biology from Mary Washington College and M.S. in Coral
        Geochemistry from the University of Maryland. Throughout the years she
        has tutored in math and science, including SAT prep.  She also spent
        time teaching marine science to elementary students in the Florida Keys
        and as a Teaching Assistant to undergrads in Environmental Geology at
        UMD.  While teaching at UMD, she won several teaching awards, including
        the Distinguished Teaching Award in 2001.  The first decade of her
        career she has been involved in marine and environmental research at the
        Smithsonian Institution’s Marine Systems Lab and Paleobiology
        Department.


        In 2004, Ms. Allegra took a break from research to stay home with her daughter, who was followed by a baby sister in 2005.  When her eldest daughter entered preschool in 2007, she wanted her to have a positive first experience to start her love of science early.  Ms. Allegra started teaching science to her daughter’s preschool class and the birth of The Science Seed™ concept began.

        Ms. Vesta has been teaching children from preschool to middle school
        since 1996.  She received her BS in Elementary/Early Childhood at
        Kutztown University in Kutztown, Pa. While attending Kutztown
        University, she played field hockey and volunteered at a juvenile
        detention center. She enjoyed helping children and decided to become a
        teacher. After graduating, she moved to Virginia to live closer to her
        family and to start teaching. Her first job was a first grade teacher in
        Prince George’s County, MD.   In 2000, Ms. Vesta moved to Maryland and
        starting teaching in Virginia. That’s where her love for teaching
        science began. She became the Visiting Science Teacher for three schools
        in Alexandria City Public Schools. She taught students from preschool
        through sixth grade hands-on science experiments using the scientific
        method.  She also loves to spend time with her nieces and nephews from
        Pennsylvania and Texas and has enjoyed teaching for The Science Seed for
        several years. (Teaching with The Science Seed since 2013)

      text: Jen loves making discoveries and getting messy with young children! She
        received a BS in Geology with a Minor in Environmental Studies from
        James Madison University and enjoyed a career in the field of
        environmental consulting before taking time off to raise her two
        children. While her children were in preschool, Jen began to develop a
        deep interest in early childhood development.  She began teaching
        preschool music classes across the Northern Virginia area in 2001 and
        then moved into the classroom where she has worked as a lead preschool
        teacher since 2011. Now that her own children are all grown up, she is
        enjoying the opportunity to enrich her days further by sharing her love
        of science with children through The Science Seed program. (Teaching
        with The Science Seed since 2016)

        Sarah traces her love of science and nature back to her earliest days of
        childhood, where she felt most at home in the woods, examining insects,
        frogs or leaves, or with her hands in the dirt.  After graduating from
        James Madison University with a BS in Biology, she earned her MS in
        Environmental Studies with a concentration in Biology from the Medical
        University of South Carolina and College of Charleston (joint MS
        program).  Sarah discovered a love of teaching while in graduate school,
        where for two years, she taught biology laboratories covering a wide
        range of general biology topics to freshmen students at the College of
        Charleston. Following graduate school, she moved to the DC area to work
        as an Environmental Scientist for Science Applications International
        Corporation (SAIC). Here, her consulting work focused on the field of
        global climate change and carbon sequestration.  After seven years
        working as a consultant, Sarah became a mom to two girls (now ages 10
        and 13) and decided to leave the workplace to devote her time to raising
        her daughters. Science was never far from the picture however, as the
        hours at home were filled with countless creative science experiments,
        nature walks and outdoor biology lessons. Sarah also devoted much of
        this time to volunteering in her daughters’ preschool and elementary
        classrooms, Girl Scout troops, and Sunday school classes. Teaching for
        The Science Seed feels like coming full circle, and she is delighted to
        work with children, inspiring wonder and igniting a desire to fully
        engage with and care for the natural world. (Teaching with The Science
        Seed since 2017)
